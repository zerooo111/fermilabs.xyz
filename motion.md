## JavaScript

### Get started
- [Get started with Motion](/docs/quick-start.md): Learn how to install Motion and create your first animation. Motion can animate anything and is the only animation library capable of hardware accelerated animations.

### Animations
- [animate](/docs/animate.md): Learn how to use Motion's animate() function. Animate an element to a target using hardware accelerated animations.
- [Easing functions](/docs/easing-functions.md): Easing functions change the speed of an animation throughout the course of its duration. Learn which ones are included with Motion and how to use them.
